# VincentApp2 :

- this is being done as a simple "Hello World" Android/Kotlin mobile app.
- lk at previous VincentApp = get sizes, colours, etc 'xact same' ... u can open the xml files and get the 'xact' details etc T
- i can also develop this ONE app = add viewbind, databind, room, sql d-base, etc = BxB (as i go/as i learn) ...
- AND u can also gear it towards : UR 1ST PUBLISHED ON GOOGLEPLAY APP
- THINK : NXT 'TRY' APP I BUILD = SHOULD BE THE 'AD' APP = so i at least get an idea of how 'ad's r done
- (i still think a chess clock is a good achieveable 1st app to publish) ...
+ u can also make it T as work/rest (etc ?) timer ... (can develop it as go = ver2, etc)
